## The Daily Loop

Shoppers have money. Shoppers have needs. If you meet a shopper's needs, they give you money. It's practically free money!

#### Objective

Build out your shopping district to meet your shoppers' needs and keep them coming back for more. Earn $10,000 in 5 days and you win!

#### How to Play

Select shops from the right-hand menu and place them into the town. When shoppers pass a shop that meets one of their needs for the first time, they will enter it and pay you to meet their need.

Different shoppers have different needs and different shops meet different needs. Hover over a shopper or shop to see more details in the left-hand menu.

Press "Start Day" to start the shopping day and watch as shoppers flock to your shops.

Different coloured shoppers indicate they have more unmet needs:

-   Green = 0
-   Cyan = 1
-   Blue = 2
-   And so on...

Try to make every shopper turn green before they complete their shopping loop.

This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2025.
